# Algoritmos-Caso-005
Probabilistic algorithm
Suppose there is a 1080x920 screen and K lines are drawn leaving any point at X = 0 or Y = 0 and reaching any other point at X = 1079 or Y = 919.
Write a probabilistic algorithm in C ++ where given the list of the K lines drawn determine which 1-digit numbers were formed in the 2D display of those lines.
